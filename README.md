## :four: Troubleshooting Records

- [DL-API Discussions](https://github.com/AI-Play/DL-API/discussions)

<br/>

## :five: Deployment Process

1. Write app.yaml and Dockerfile (change port to 8080 -> ∵ default port value for App Engine)
2. Change .env for deployment (as it is read)
3. gcloud app create --project=ai-play-dl-api
4. gcloud components install app-engine-python
5. gcloud app deploy (Check if payment is set up for the Google App Engine project before deploying)
6. Connect the Github Repo to Cloud Build for deployment

## :six: Development Environment Setup

<details>
  <summary><b>Expand</b></summary>

```
// Create a new virtual environment
// 1. Move to the directory which has python version we need to use
// 2. Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

// 3. Activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate

# 4. Install necessary modules and packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. DB table migration
# (To be done separately after deployment, unless the content changes. Uncomment or comment out the relevant code in the Dockerfile before deployment as needed)
alembic upgrade head
```

##### Run Development Server

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
